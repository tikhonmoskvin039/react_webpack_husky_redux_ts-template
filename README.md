## Why ⁉️

Recently, I've made a lot of NextJs webs. And setting up each time from scratch with all configurations is really time consuming.

Therefore, I created this template for myself to make creating apps easier, along with some useful tips I've picked up from creating those apps. You are welcome to make changes or even maintain your own forks.
